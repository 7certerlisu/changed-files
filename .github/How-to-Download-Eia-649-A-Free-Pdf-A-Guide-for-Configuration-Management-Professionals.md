## What is Eia 649 A?

Eia 649 A provides CM requirements that are tailored for defense contracts, based on the five CM functions: configuration planning and management, configuration identification, configuration change management, configuration status accounting, and configuration verification and audit.

The acquirer is the entity that specifies the CM requirements for a contract, while the supplier is the entity that delivers the product that meets those requirements. Eia 649 A helps to ensure that both parties have a common understanding of the CM expectations and responsibilities.
