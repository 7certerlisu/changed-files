## What is Sprint Layout 6.0?
 
Sprint Layout 6.0 is a software application that can help you design and edit your PCB layouts from scratch. It supports single-sided, double-sided, and multilayer PCBs, and provides an extensive library of predefined components for SMD layouts. You can also draw and add your own components to the library, and drag and drop them directly to your layout. You can move, rotate, label, and modify the components as you wish, with no limitations or restrictions.
 
Sprint Layout 6.0 also features a built-in auto router that can help you route the tracks automatically, a photo view function that lets you preview the PCB layout in realistic mode, a design-rule-check function that verifies the correctness of your layout, a point-to-point autorouter that connects the pads with straight lines, and an automatic ground-plane function that fills the unused areas of your board with copper.
 
You can export your PCB layouts to various formats, such as BMP, JPG, GIF, EMF, Gerber, Excellon, and HPGL. You can also print your layouts directly from the software, or use them for DIY production or commercial manufacturing.
