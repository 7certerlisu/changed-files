## What are Serial Number and Product Key?
 
A serial number is a unique code that identifies your copy of AutoCAD 2010. It is usually composed of 11 digits, such as 000-00000000. A product key is a code that specifies the product you have purchased and the features you can access. It is usually composed of five digits, such as 001B1 for AutoCAD 2010.
 
You can find these codes in different ways, depending on how you obtained your AutoCAD 2010 software. For example:
 
- If you bought a physical copy of AutoCAD 2010, you can find the serial number and product key on the label of the DVD case or on the product packaging.
- If you downloaded AutoCAD 2010 from the Autodesk website, you can find the serial number and product key in the confirmation email or in your Autodesk account.
- If you are a student or an educator, you can get a free three-year license of AutoCAD 2010 from the Autodesk Education Community. You can find the serial number and product key in your Autodesk account or in the email you received after registering.

## How to Activate AutoCAD 2010 64 Bit?
 
Once you have your serial number and product key, you can activate your AutoCAD 2010 64 bit by following these steps:

1. Install AutoCAD 2010 64 bit on your computer. You can use the installation media or download the installer from the Autodesk website.
2. When prompted, enter your serial number and product key. For example, Serial Number: 000-00000000, Product Key: 001B1.
3. Click Next and follow the instructions to complete the installation.
4. Do not run AutoCAD 2010 yet. Go to the folder where you installed AutoCAD 2010, usually C:\Program Files\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2010.
5. Copy the file adlmint.dll from the Crack folder and paste it into the installation folder. This will replace the original file and bypass the activation process.
6. Run AutoCAD 2010 and enjoy your full version.

## Conclusion
 
Activating AutoCAD 2010 64 bit is not difficult if you have the serial number and product key. You just need to enter them during the installation and replace one file with another. However, this method is only for educational purposes and we do not recommend using cracked software. If you want to use AutoCAD 2010 legally and professionally, you should buy a license from Autodesk or an authorized reseller.
